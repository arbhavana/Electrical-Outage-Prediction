# Electrical-Outage-Prediction
This project aims in predicting the total number of electrical outages occurring on day given the corresponding weather conditions on that day and classifies the predicted number of outages according to the cause of the outage.
In the dataset used here it contains the outages occurred due to Animals, Trees, Lightning and Equipment failure. Hence a model that classifies the oouatages into these categories of causes is built.
This dataset is collected from a github source.
